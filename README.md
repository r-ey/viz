# **Viz!**

## **Analytical** and **visualization** program for your academic journey, curated by student for student


### What

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualization
This application will visualize your grades in *pie chart* and *bar*.
It will ask about the grading breakdown and then the grade itself.
- *Pie chart* -> This chart will break down all the grading components per percentage
- *Bar* -> This graph will visualize your total and target grade

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analytic
This program also has built-in analytic tools.
It will ask the user's target grade and calculate it.
It will automatically calculate the best possible scheme to achieve your target based on **percentage priority**.


### Who

All students **(not only UBC students)** who wish to visualize their grades throughout the term and 
calculate their total grades using the analytical tool


### Why

I want to create something people use, not only for the course grade.
Then, this idea came to my mind. 
Until now, we can only see our **grades in text**.
We just know if we get *A* or *B* or *80/100*.
However, I firmly believe the **most essential part of learning is the journey itself, not the result**.
Someone can achieve *80/100* in many different ways. 
For example, the first person has good midterms but bad finals.
A second person has bad midterms but good finals. 
Ultimately, both of them get *80/100*, but we don't know the **challenging journey** behind *80/100*. 
The analytic part of this application is to motivate people to achieve their target. 
People will be more **motivated** if they have a "real number" target.
That is the reason why I want to create this application: 
**to draw and tell people's hard work story to achieve their goal because everyone has a unique academic journey**.


### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to fill my grades to corresponding grade components
- As a user, I want to be able to see my grades per grade components
- As a user, I want to be able to add and delete my courses
- As a user, I want to be able to have the analysis to fulfil my target
- As a user, I want to be able to save multiple terms
- As a user, I want to be able to resume and fill my grade to corresponding components 
without having to fill all of them again
